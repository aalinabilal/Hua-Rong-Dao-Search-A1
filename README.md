# Hua-Rong-Dao-Search-A1
This project provides solutions to the Hua Rang Dao puzzle using two search algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and A* Search. The puzzle is a combinatorial challenge where the goal is to rearrange tiles within a grid to reach a target configuration.

# Problem Description:

The Hua Rang Dao puzzle is a sliding puzzle where the objective is to rearrange pieces within a grid to match a target configuration. The puzzle can be solved by exploring the state space using search algorithms, with DFS and A* Search implemented as the primary techniques to find a solution.

# Problem Details:

State Space: The possible configurations of the puzzle.
Goal State: The target configuration that the puzzle aims to reach.
Moves: A set of legal moves that can be performed on the puzzle.
Search Algorithms Implemented:
DFS: A depth-first exploration of the state space.
A* Search: A heuristic-based search method that uses a cost function to guide the search towards the goal state efficiently.
